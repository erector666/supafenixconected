# Remember Me Setup Guide

## 🔧 **To Fix the "Remember Me" Functionality**

The error you're seeing is because the `sessions` table hasn't been created in your Supabase database yet. Here's how to fix it:

### **Step 1: Run the SQL Script in Supabase**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Open your Supabase project
   - Navigate to the **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Sessions Table Script**
   - Copy the contents of `create-sessions-table.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click **Run** to execute the script

### **Step 2: Verify the Table was Created**

After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ `sessions` table created
- ✅ Indexes created for performance
- ✅ RLS policies enabled
- ✅ Cleanup function created

### **Step 3: Test the Remember Me Feature**

1. **Login with "Remember Me" checked**
2. **Refresh the page** - you should stay logged in
3. **Close and reopen the browser** - you should still be logged in

## 🚨 **Current Issues Fixed:**

1. **JSX Syntax Error**: ✅ Fixed - The div structure is now correct
2. **Session Creation Error**: ⏳ Pending - Need to run the SQL script

## 📋 **SQL Script Contents:**

The `create-sessions-table.sql` file contains:
- Sessions table with proper structure
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Cleanup function for expired sessions
- Proper comments and documentation

## 🔍 **What the Sessions Table Does:**

- **Stores user sessions** with expiration dates
- **Supports "Remember Me"** with 30-day sessions
- **Regular sessions** expire after 24 hours
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired sessions
- **Secure** with proper RLS policies

## ✅ **After Setup:**

Once you run the SQL script, the "Remember Me" functionality will work perfectly:
- ✅ Users can check "Remember Me" during login
- ✅ Sessions persist across browser restarts
- ✅ Automatic logout when sessions expire
- ✅ Secure session management

**Note**: The JSX syntax error has been fixed. The only remaining issue is the missing database table, which will be resolved once you run the SQL script in Supabase.
